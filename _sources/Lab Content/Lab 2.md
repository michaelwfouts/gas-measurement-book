# 2 - Master Meter Proving
## Introduction to Proving

In natural gas measurement, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of flow meters is not just a technical necessity but a foundational aspect of industry operations. The integrity of financial transactions and regulatory compliance hinge on the reliability of measurements made by the meters and transmitters/gauges.  To ensure meters are measuring reliably, a process known as proving is used which provides a reference measurement to compare against the meter under test. This lab is dedicated to exploring the principles, operation, and significance of the Master Meter configuration for proving, a cornerstone method for calibrating and verifying the accuracy of gas flow meters without taking the meters out of line.

The Master Meter, also known as a Transfer Prover, is a high-precision reference meter used in field proving standards. By placing this device in series with the meter under test, this configuration allows both the Master Meter and the test meter to concurrently measure the same flow of test gas (typically air) facilitating a direct comparison of their readings under identical operational conditions. A comparative measurement approach can then be used to calculate the correction factors for the meter and input into the flow computer. 

The focus of this laboratory is twofold: to impart a practical understanding of how the Master Meter configuration operates via hands on demonstration and to illuminate why and where this method is crucial for measurement accuracy. Through hands-on experiments, students will learn how to calculate the meter calibration factor by comparing the volume measured by the highly accurate Master Meter against the volume recorded by the test meter. This calibration factor is instrumental in identifying and correcting any discrepancies in the test meter's readings across a range of flow rates, ensuring its accuracy and reliability.

## Lab Directions:
***NOTE:*** These lab instructions are specific for an Eagle XARTU Transfer Prover with an AL-800 American Meter Diaphragm Meter with a meter run configuration.  However, the general outline of the lab can still be followed for other configurations (such as the more common rotary meter in a rotary meter loop).

1. Isolate the meter from process flow and blow down meter run.  
2. Remove the index from the top of the meter and replace with the gate box.  
3. Install the Master Meter in series with the meter under test (in this particular lab, it will be upstream of the meter under test).  
4. Install the Air Blower in series with the meters (in this particular lab, it will be downstream).  
5. Hook up all proper instrumentation to the gate box.
6. Turn on the gate box and follow the on screen wizard to test up until it asks to begin the test.
7. Identify the max flow rate of the meter.  The meter will need to be tested at 20%, 50%, and 80% of max flow. Determine what these flow rates are.
8. Turn on the blower and use a throttle valve to manipulate the flow until you reach 20% max flow.  Use the gate box display to identify the current flow rate.  Then, start the prover test and record the error.  
9. Repeat the previous step for 50% and 80% of max flow.
10. Disassemble the prover setup and return the meter to service.

2. What is the difference between As Found and As Left data collection and why is it important?

3. Why does the proving process need to be performed on the diaphragm meter?

4. Create a plot, either by hand or using a computer aid such as Microsoft Excel, to show the error collected on the y-axis and the flowrate tested on the x-axis.  Why does the error need to be collected at different flowrates?
