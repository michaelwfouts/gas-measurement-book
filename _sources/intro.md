# Welcome to Gas Measurement for Technicians

This book was written to provide a free online resource to introduce someone at the technician level to the world of gas measurement.  While the technician role at any company largely involves hands-on labor (of which should be supplemented with this book), this book provides resources to understand what gas measurement is and why it is done.  As part of the continued progression of free resources, if you'd like to add, correct, or collaborate to this work, feel free to pull the source repository or reach out to the author.
