# 2 - Master Meter Proving
## Introduction to Proving

In natural gas measurement, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of flow meters is not just a technical necessity but a foundational aspect of industry operations. The integrity of financial transactions and regulatory compliance hinge on the reliability of measurements made by the meters and transmitters/gauges.  To ensure meters are measuring reliably, a process known as proving is used which provides a reference measurement to compare against the meter under test. This lab is dedicated to exploring the principles, operation, and significance of the Master Meter configuration for proving, a cornerstone method for calibrating and verifying the accuracy of gas flow meters without taking the meters out of line.

The Master Meter, also known as a Transfer Prover, is a high-precision reference meter used in field proving standards. By placing this device in series with the meter under test, this configuration allows both the Master Meter and the test meter to concurrently measure the same flow of test gas (typically air) facilitating a direct comparison of their readings under identical operational conditions. A comparative measurement approach can then be used to calculate the correction factors for the meter and input into the flow computer. 

The focus of this laboratory is twofold: to impart a practical understanding of how the Master Meter configuration operates via hands on demonstration and to illuminate why and where this method is crucial for measurement accuracy. Through hands-on experiments, students will learn how to calculate the meter calibration factor by comparing the volume measured by the highly accurate Master Meter against the volume recorded by the test meter. This calibration factor is instrumental in identifying and correcting any discrepancies in the test meter's readings across a range of flow rates, ensuring its accuracy and reliability.

## Questions
1. Please draw the setup used to prove the diaphragm meter in the lab making sure to identify the following components: 
    a. Proving Meter
    b. Meter Under Test
    c. Proving Flow Computer
    d. Blower
    e. Temperature Probe
    f. Pressure Tap
    g. Interconnecting Piping.

2. Why does the proving process need to be performed on the diaphragm meter?

3. Create a plot, either by hand or using a computer aid such as Microsoft Excel, to show the error collected on the y-axis and the flowrate tested on the x-axis.  Why does the error need to be collected at different flowrates?
