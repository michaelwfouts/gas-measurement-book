# 2 - Ultrasonic Meters
## Introduction to Ultrasonic Meters

Ultrasonic meters represent a significant advancement in flow measurement technologies.  Being a digital first type of measurement, it allows for several advantages over mechanical types of meters (such as positive displacement and turbine meters). Ultrasonic flow meters measure flow rate by sending ultrasonic sound waves diagonally across a pipe through the flowing gas. This creates a small time difference between the upstream and downstream signals that indicates flow velocity. They work by measuring the transmission time difference between upstream and downstream ultrasonic pulses. This transit time difference is proportional to flow velocity. The cross-sectional area of the pipe yields the volumetric flow rate.  A visualization and more detailed explanation can be found at the video below:

### Advantages of Ultrasonic Meters

Ultrasonic meters are one of the most technologically advanced methods to measure natural gas.  While this typically comes with a heavy price tag, engineering and design teams will often consider the price tag worth it for high volume applications.  The advantages of Ultrasonic Meters include: 

1. <ins>Accuracy and Reliability</ins>: Ultrasonic meters provide high-precision measurements by capturing the time difference between ultrasonic pulses traveling upstream and downstream through the gas. This method is highly accurate, ensuring that gas distribution and billing are based on reliable data. The absence of moving parts reduces wear and tear, further enhancing measurement reliability over time.
