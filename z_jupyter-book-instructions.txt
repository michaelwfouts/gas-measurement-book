To build the book via anaconda, use Anaconda Prompt and navigate to the correct 
directory where you cloned the repo locally.  From one folder up, run `jb build gas-measurement-book`.
This will build the book and any changes.

To push to GitHub Pages for public viewing, using the `ghp-import` library, run 
`ghp-import -n -p -f _build/html` from the main branch of the root directory (different
directory than the build, one more down).  This assumes that the `gh-pages` branch is already
created.
